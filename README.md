#LinkedIn - The Ultimate LinkedIn Clone

![LinkedIn Clone](https://i.ibb.co/D5vF36x/linkedIn.png)

## ðŸ“£ Summary
This application is built based on the original linkedIn app, it is built with the Next Js frame work and uses tailwind Css for styling. It uses other frameworks like framer motion for animation, recoil for state management. It is a full stack application that uses the mongo DB for database storage. The build includes two pages, the landing page where you can sign in with google a provider from the next-auth, and the feeds page where you can perform basic crud operations like creating a post, deleting your post and seeing all the post in the db. It also fetches data from an external api(News api) to populate the linkedin news section. It does not implement all the functionalities of the real linkedIn application, but it works fine and it is a beautiful clone which is also responsive.
